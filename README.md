# OpenPhobia
A project of reimplementing Phasmophobia mechanics into rbfx just for fun!

[Join Discord](https://discord.gg/nUrBAw346K)

## Scope
The scope of this project is to reimplement Phasmophobia game mechanics without stealing assets. **Only** CC assets as well as selfmade ones are allowed for use.

Currently the project is all rights reserved, however I plan on finding a suitable license (suggestions are welcome!).


## Notes
This project is not yet playable. You can, however, help in its development by creating suitable media!
